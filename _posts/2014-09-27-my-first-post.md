You'll find this post in your `_posts` directory - edit this post and re-build (or run with the `-w` switch) to see your changes!
To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention: YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight javascript %}
// some test function
function(){
  var a =11;
  var b = 5;
  var x = a + b;
  return x;
}
{% endhighlight %}
